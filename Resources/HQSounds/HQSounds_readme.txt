High Quality Sounds v.1.0 by Daedalus

Initialy this project was created for "UFO: The Two Sides". Version 0.9 was a quick port to OpenXCom, but it lacked many sound files. Since version 1.0 mod covers all of the old sounds + adds some more (like different launch sounds for craft missiles, separate fire effects for pistols/rifles/heavy guns...).

Additional credits:
I used like 2 or 3 sounds that were found by Gifty and included in his "Remastered Sounds Project" mod. I really hope he doesn't mind...
