en-US:
 STR_VICTORY_1: "As you enter the chamber you see the alien brain - the object of your quest. Before you can aim to kill, it communicates to you telepathically. It implores you to listen to its arguments for survival before you make the decision to pull the trigger."
 STR_VICTORY_2: "The brain speaks: 'Many millions of years ago the planet you call Mars was alive. This life was brought to a barren planet by our civilization as it was to yours. For millions of years, we have visited your planet and genetically developed your species. You cannot kill us, you are part of us..."
 STR_VICTORY_3: "Here is the center of Martian civilization - the pyramids built millions of years before yours - by a species which is your ancestor. No planet is beyond our reach. This power could be yours before long. All we ask is your co-operation..."
 STR_GAME_OVER_1: "The aliens attempt to exterminate all humanity, destroying cities and poisoning the air and sea. The resistance of earth armies is futile in the face of vastly superior technology. Surviving generations suffer terrible mutations as they flee alien destruction. They are rounded up into slave camps to help transform earth into an alien colony that is part of some unknown empire."
 STR_GAME_OVER_2: "The knowledge gained through the XCOM project is lost forever. You have failed to save the earth."
 STR_VICTORY_4: "The alien brain is interrupted by a burst of hot plasma, and the entire alien force is defeated."
 STR_VICTORY_5: "Once the aliens have lost Mars they have lost the earth. Before long the XCOM research allows humanity to flourish once more, and claim Mars for itself. The alien menace has gone, but for how long, no one knows..."
 STR_YOU_HAVE_FAILED: "You have failed to stop the alien onslaught. One by one the funding nations sign pacts with aliens promising technology, prosperity, and peace. However, it soon becomes clear that the aliens have other plans..."
