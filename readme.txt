=== Quickstart ===

You can find information about the classes and their skills in the Ufopedia
under the "MILITARY MOLDING" category.

The changes on weapons and armors can be found under the "WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT" section.

=== Goals and influences ===

This started out as some experiments with Yankes scripts and soon got out of hand.
I wanted to have skills, like in the remakes and wanted to see which ones I could do.
Turns out I can do most of them.

So this then turned into a more complex mod with a class and skill system at its core and
with mechanical influences from the remakes (EU2012/XCOM2 and Phoenix Point).

My goal is to extend the vanilla X-Com experience with some
mechanics, items, units & lore references from the newer X-Com titles.

While my focus is on the class & skill system, I also completely rebalanced the
weapons and armors and some other gameplay elements.

I also want to try to add only graphics which keep the X-Com style and which harmonize
with the existing graphics. Each tier of items should be visually distinguishable.

Many thanks to XOps and his Xeno Operations for most of the graphical enhancements.
When looking through his modification of the game, I realized we shared many common goals
and it felt like his work was made with the same visual vision as my mod.

=== Concepts ===

Soldiers of each class can be hired directly by X-COM.
Soldiers can choose to undergo the military molding process, gaining access to their class skills in the process.
Classed soldiers receive additional active and passive skills for each level of training.
The active ones are activated with the special icon and the passive ones are always active.

There are three training phases. The initial molding process is awarded to soldiers when they are
hired by X-Com. The Second Phase (or Advanced Training) and Third Phase (or Elite Training)
add additional skills respectively.

Advanced level training requires: The second "Combat Experience" decoration,
which is awarded for 4 kills and 8 missions.

Elite level training requires: The fourth "Combat Experience" decoration,
which is awarded for 10 kills and 16 missions.

=== Skills ===

For a list of the currently implemented skills per class please refer to the file
Rulesets/classSkills.rul line 10, heading "Class Skill list".

=== Tiers ===

Weapons and armors all follow the three Tier concept.

T1 is available from the start.

T2 depends on alien alloys.
 - You should aim at researching "Laser Weapons" and "Predator Armor" until April.

T3 depends on Elerium-115.
 - You should aim at researching "Plasma Weapons" and "Warden Armor" until August.
