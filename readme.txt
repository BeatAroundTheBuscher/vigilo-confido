Classes & Skills for OXCE
-------------------------

In-Game:
You can find information about the classes and their skills in the Ufopedia
under the "MILITARY MOLDING" category.

The changes on weapons and armors can be found under the "WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT" section.

Concept:

Soldiers of each class can be hired directly by X-COM.
Soldiers can choose to undergo the military molding process, gaining access to their class skills in the process.
Classed soldiers receive additional active and passive skills for each level of training.
The active ones are activated with the special icon and the passive ones are always active.

There are three training phases. The initial molding process is the first one.
Second Phase (or Advanced Training) and Third Phase (or Elite Training) add additional skills respectively.

Requirements for initial molding are: Minimum stat requirement reached for the class.
