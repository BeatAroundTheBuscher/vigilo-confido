Classes & Skills for OXCE
-------------------------

While you could use this mod in a vanilla playthrough I would currently not recommend it.
Vanilla XCOM does not have the weapn arsenal needed to give the classes their specialized arms (eg. Shotgun, LMG, Sword, Sniper Rifle).

I was using Area 51 when building this mod and you can find my integration efforts in Ruleset/area51_integration.rul

You can of course use any other mod that has weapons that would fit the classes and attach the needed tags yourself.

You can find information about the classes and their skills in the Ufopedia under council reports.

All soldiers start as rookies without a class, just like in the regular game.
Upon reaching squaddie rank, soldiers get access to military molding. If their stats allow it (training rooms help),
they can go for the initial molding process. These are called "Ranger Molding" or "Heavy Molding" respectively,
and can be found in the soldier transformation selection screen.

After the initial molding the soldier gains access to the first two class skills. The active class skill can
now be accessed via the special weapon icon in the top right corner of the battlescape when a classed soldier
is selected.

So the requirements for initial molding are: At least squaddie rank and minimum stat requirement reached for the class.

Advanced level training requires: At least rank sergeant and the second "Combat Experience" decoration.

Elite level training requires: At least rank captain and the fourth "Combat Experience" decoration.

Most of the skills are passive, meaning they are active all the time or get activated automatically.

There are however two skills which need to be activated manually by the player. The first is the active class skill becoming
accessible after the initial molding and the second one is the elite level active skill which becomes available after the elite level training.

The elite level active skill needs a skill amplifier to activate.
