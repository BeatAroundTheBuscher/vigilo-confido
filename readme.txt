Classes & Skills for OXCE
-------------------------

While you could use this mod in a vanilla playthrough I would currently not recommend it.
Vanilla XCOM does not have the weapon arsenal needed to give the classes their specialized arms (eg. Shotgun, LMG, Sword, Sniper Rifle).

I was using Area 51 when building this mod and you can find my integration efforts in Ruleset/area51_integration.rul

You can of course use any other mod that has weapons that would fit the classes and attach the needed tags yourself.

You can find information about the classes and their skills in the Ufopedia under the "MILITARY MOLDING" category.

Concept:

Soldiers of each class can be hired directly by X-COM.
Soldiers can choose to undergo the military molding process, gaining access to their class skills in the process.
Classed soldiers receive additional active and passive skills for each level of training.
The active ones are activated with the special icon and the passive ones are always active.

There are three training phases. The initial molding process is the first one.
Second Phase (or Advanced Training) and Third Phase (or Elite Training) add additional skills respectively.

So the requirements for initial molding are: Minimum stat requirement reached for the class.

Advanced level training requires: At least rank sergeant and the second "Combat Experience" decoration.

Elite level training requires: At least rank captain and the fourth "Combat Experience" decoration.

Required: Presumably OXCE 6.4
