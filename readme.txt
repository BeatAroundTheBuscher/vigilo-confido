Classes & Skills for OXCE
-------------------------

In-Game:
You can find information about the classes and their skills in the Ufopedia
under the "MILITARY MOLDING" category.

Concept:

Soldiers of each class can be hired directly by X-COM.
Soldiers can choose to undergo the military molding process, gaining access to their class skills in the process.
Classed soldiers receive additional active and passive skills for each level of training.
The active ones are activated with the special icon and the passive ones are always active.

There are three training phases. The initial molding process is the first one.
Second Phase (or Advanced Training) and Third Phase (or Elite Training) add additional skills respectively.

So the requirements for initial molding are: Minimum stat requirement reached for the class.

Advanced level training requires: At least rank sergeant and the second "Combat Experience" decoration.

Elite level training requires: At least rank captain and the fourth "Combat Experience" decoration.

=== Tiers ===
Weapons and armors all follow the three Tier concept.

T1 is available from the start.
T2 depends on alien alloys.
T3 depends on Elerium-115.

Armor & Weapon Tiers
T1 - Kevlar Armor   & Conventional Weapons
T2 - Predator Armor & Laser Weapons
T3 - Warden Armor   & Plasma Weapons


=== Additional Vanilla Balancing ===

 - Laser Weapons not reasearchable from the start
 - Blaster Launcher not that readily available
 - Laser weapons need recharging

Required: Presumably OXCE 6.4

DISCLAIMER:
I tried my best to track down the creators of all the assets I borrowed from other mods.
Since I am only human, I might have made some mistakes. So if you find something that is
credited falsely, has missing credits or have problems with the inclusion of your creation
in this mod, then please contact me. (memmaker on the OpenXcom discord.)
