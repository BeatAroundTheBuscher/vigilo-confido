=== CREDITS ===

DISCLAIMER:
I tried my best to track down the creators of all the assets I borrowed from other mods.
Since I am only human, I might have made some mistakes. So if you find something that is
credited falsely, has missing credits or have problems with the inclusion of your creation
in this mod, then please contact me. (memmaker on the OpenXcom discord.)

Special Thanks to:
Meridian for his fork, his merging of my PRs and his constant support
Yankes for his script engine which made most of this possible and of course his support
Microprose and Julian Gollop

Extra Special Thanks to the creators of these mods and their collaborators.
I frequently consulted their RuleSets in order to learn for myself.
Thanks for all the time you guys spent writing RuleSets and Scripts so others could
use them as examples to come up with their own mod:

X-Com Files    - A great vision and even better execution.
Area 51        - I really enjoyed this take on the game and the maps are really good.
Warhammer 40k  - This is a good example for what dedication can do. Way to go, guys.
X-Piratez      - The scale of this is just unbelievable.
XenoOperations - Just love the sprite work here.

And of course, all the other great modders, who I might have forgotten.
Thank you, all you nice people in the OXC/OXCE community who have a great spirit and
create new gameplay experiences for us all to enjoy. You rock!
